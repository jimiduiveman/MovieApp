# Review

In general, my application was found very clear. Compliments regarding design. But there were a few opportunities for improvement.
After noting these opportunities for improvement of my application I incorporated the feedback in my application.
These opportunities are listed below:

* Add marks to your application so that people can easily see which part does something
* Change my "Try Again" when login credentials are false to "Dismiss" in the alert. Because you're not directly prompted with a new chance.

* Add more comments to your code

* Place all your stucts in a folder called "Methods"

* The loadFromFirebase() function on the detailpage is very big and takes a lot of time when runnig everytime to update. You could do this only once and adjust things based on status of variables set based on this retrieval.

* Usage of fileprivate with collectionView

* Update button with variable instead of based on firebase data (keeping UI/Data seperated)

This review has helped me improve my application.
Looking forward to the project!
